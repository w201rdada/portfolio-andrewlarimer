  title = {Designing {{Spontaneous Speech Search Interface}} for {{Historical Archives}}},
  abstract = {Spontaneous speech in the form of conversations, meetings, voice-mail, interviews, oral history, etc. is one of the most ubiquitous forms of human communication. Search engines providing access to such speech collections have the potential to better inform intelligence and make relevant data over vast audio/video archives available to users. This project presents a search user interface design supporting search tasks over a speech collection consisting of an historical archive with nearly 52,000 audiovisual testimonies of survivors and witnesses of the Holocaust and other genocides. The design incorporates faceted search, along with other UI elements like highlighted search items, tags, snippets, etc., to promote discovery and exploratory search. Two different designs have been created to support both manual and automated transcripts. Evaluation was performed using human subjects to measure accuracy in retrieving results, understanding user-perspective on the design elements, and ease of parsing information.},

  abstract = {Applications which use human speech as an input require a speech interface with high recognition accuracy. The words or phrases in the recognised text are annotated with a machine-understandable meaning and linked to knowledge graphs for further processing by the target application. These semantic annotations of recognised words can be represented as a subject-predicate-object triples which collectively form a graph often referred to as a knowledge graph. This type of knowledge representation facilitates to use speech interfaces with any spoken input application, since the information is represented in logical, semantic form, retrieving and storing can be followed using any web standard query languages. In this work, we develop a methodology for linking speech input to knowledge graphs and study the impact of recognition errors in the overall process. We show that for a corpus with lower WER, the annotation and linking of entities to the DBpedia knowledge graph is considerable. DBpedia Spotlight, a tool to interlink text documents with the linked open data is used to link the speech recognition output to the DBpedia knowledge graph. Such a knowledge-based speech recognition interface is useful for applications such as question answering or spoken dialog systems.},

  abstract = {Human saliva is an easily accessible biological fluid and contains a variety of disease-related biomarkers, which makes it a potential diagnostic medium. The clinical use of salivary/oral fluid biomarkers to identify oral and systemic conditions requires the development of non-invasive screening and diagnostic technologies, and is among the main goals of oral fluid researchers. The analysis of the disease-specific oral and systemic biomarkers in saliva and oral fluids (i.e., mouth-rinse, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and peri-implantitis sulcular fluid (PISF)) is demanding. Several factors influence their expression and release; these factors include the intracellular location, the molecular size and the flow characteristics of the biological fluid. The type of saliva/oral fluid utilized for the diagnostics affects the analysis. High sensitivity together with sophisticated methods and techniques are essential to get a useful outcome. We describe here a recently developed mouth-rinse that is practical, convenient and inexpensive, as well as PISF chair-side/point of care (PoC) lateral-flow active matrix metalloproteinase (aMMP-8) immunoassays to detect, predict and monitor the course and treatment of periodontitis and peri-implantitis.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are two leading causes of death worldwide. CVD and cancer share risk factors such as obesity and diabetes mellitus and have common diagnostic biomarkers such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein. Thus, timely and accurate diagnosis of these two correlated diseases is of high interest to both the research and healthcare communities. Most conventional methods for CVD and cancer biomarker detection such as microwell plate-based immunoassay and polymerase chain reaction often suffer from high costs, low test speeds, and complicated procedures. Recently, lab-on-a-chip (LoC)-based platforms have been increasingly developed for CVD and cancer biomarker sensing and analysis using various molecular and cell-based diagnostic biomarkers. These new platforms not only enable better sample preparation, chemical manipulation and reaction, high-throughput and portability, but also provide attractive features such as label-free detection and improved sensitivity due to the integration of various novel detection techniques. These features effectively improve the diagnostic test speed and simplify the detection procedure. In addition, microfluidic cell assays and organ-on-chip models offer new potential approaches for CVD and cancer diagnosis. Here we provide a mini-review focusing on recent development of LoC-based methods for CVD and cancer diagnostic biomarker measurements, and our perspectives of the challenges, opportunities and future directions.},

  abstract = {Objective
To determine the utility of oral fluids for assessment of coronary and cardiovascular (CVD) health.

Study Design
Twenty-nine patients with pre-existing CVD disease underwent an invasive cardiac procedure (alcohol septal ablation or percutaneous coronary intervention) and provided unstimulated whole saliva (UWS), sublingual swabs (LS), gingival swabs (GS) and serum at 0, 8, 16, 24, 48 hr. Concentrations of 13 relevant biomarkers were determined and correlated with levels in serum and the oral fluids.

Results
Concentrations of the majority of biomarkers were higher in UWS than LS and GS. Coronary and CVD disease biomarkers in UWS correlated better with serum than LS and GS based on group status and measures of time effect. Seven biomarkers demonstrated time effect changes consistent with serum biomarkers, including C-reactive protein and troponin I.

Conclusions
Changes in serum biomarker profiles are reflected in oral fluids suggesting that oral fluid biomarkers could aid in the assessment of cardiac ischemia/necrosis.},
