## The need for in-home diagnostics

The CDC says that in the US, up to 40% of deaths from _each_ of 5 leading causes might be preventable.[@CDCPressReleases2016] They suggest that poor behavioral choices, like high cholesterol diets and cigarette smoking, lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other ailments. In fact, almost half of all US adults (47%) demonstrate at least one of the three major risk factors for CVD: uncontrolled high blood pressure, uncontrolled high levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol, or are smokers. [@PrevalenceUncontrolledRisk]

Nevertheless, up to one-third of Americans say they avoid going to the doctor. [@WhyPeopleAvoid] This adds up to the fact that many Americans are living lifestyles that put them at risk, but are avoiding doctor visits, and are thus failing to receive the feedback that could allow for real change that would help them avoid preventable death.

It's time for the average American to be able to get more frequent feedback on how their lifestyle is effecting their health. Fortunately, developments in salivary diagnostics have led to tests for biomarkers of cancers, Alzheimer's disease, viruses including HIV, various harmful bacteria, and more.[@RathnayakeSalivaryDiagnosticsPointofCare2017] This has led to calls for dentists to take a more active role in diagnoses. But we say we can take this further, and bring the salivary diagnostic device into the home.

## Enter the Wisdom Tooth

The Wisdom Tooth is a small device, about the size of a toothbrush holder, designed with a ceramic exterior to fit in with the aesthetics of many American bathrooms. It is intended to sit on a bathroom sink countertop or in a medicine cabinet wherever an individual would store his or her toothbrush and other oral hygiene products. Its tooth theme is designed to encourage user adoption by encouraging marketing efforts that strongly associate its use with potential users' existing habits of dental care.

From the top of the device, the user will pull a test strip, about the size of a breath-freshening strip that sits on the user's tongue. The user will place this test strip on his or her tongue for thirty seconds and do some swishing to ensure it is coated in saliva.

The test strip will have a variety of reactive salivary diagnostic compounds embedded in it, and various dots will appear to indicate varying levels of reactivity within the saliva. In addition to the salivary diagnostic dots, the strip will have one or more red control borders, which should always appear to indicate that sufficient saliva coverage has been achieved.

Because the strip will be read by a computer, much smaller amounts of diagnostic compounds could be utilized than if the strip was to be read by a human. Many diagnostic tests could be included on one strip, including tests for viruses , biomarkers that might correspond to various cancers, or simply high LDL cholesterol levels. Because the strips would be sold in packs, not each strip needs to be identical, but could include a rotation of many different diangostic tests across a week's or month's worth of tests.

The strip will be placed into a rinsable tray in a drawer designed to hold it in place, and the drawer will be closed. The device's internal camera will calibrate itself against a gray strip on the tray to adjust to current lighting conditions. It will then capture imagery of the test strip to read the results. By utilzing a camera within an enclosed, lighting-controlled environment, the evaluation of the test strips will be more objective & accurate than relying on untrained individuals in highly varying lighting conditions to diagnose their own results.

The Wisdom Tooth will pair with the user's smartphone via Bluetooth to control the functions of the device, provide computing resources and receive results. Focus group testing will allow us to determine whether adding functionality as a Bluetooth speaker will also be advisable.

## Health Intervention at the Earliest Possible Stage

By creating an easy at-home test with a low footprint that can utilize cartridges of various test strips, the ability to detect many conditions early and at low cost will allow for early intervention and care. And the frequency of tests will allow for users to receive more immediate feedback when lifestyle changes lead to either increases or decreases in dangerous lipid levels.

The Wisdom Tooth in the longterm offers the user the benefit of detection of a huge array of health issues at the earliest possible stage, while maintaining full control over their own health information.
