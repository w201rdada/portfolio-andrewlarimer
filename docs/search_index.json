It’s common knowledge that the quality of a project is usually a direct result of the amount of planning that goes into it. Nevertheless, project creators frequently bypass critical planning steps. In software development, UML class diagrams are one of those documents that are too frequently skipped. These diagrams provide concrete, visual representations of how the various elements of a software system will divide responsibilities and interact with one another. And the process of collaboratively creating them allows everyone to be present for certain decisions that define the heuristics for a given software system. Without completing that process and arriving at robust class diagrams, a development team progresses more slowly, risks redundant components being created, and must constantly navigate issues of ambiguity related to the project scope, the working metaphor(s) of the system, and the division of work among the team. An example of a UML diagram is presented here: An example of a UML Class Diagram 1.2 So if they are so important, why are these documents skipped? Because of the inadequate tools currently used to create them. One common tool for collaborative diagramming is the whiteboard. While whiteboard sketches facilitate the collaborative brainstorming process, the size of the canvas is quite limited, and unless there is a very talented moderator, only a very limited portion of a project can be visualized before the board is full or the lines have become too messy to proceed. The alternate method is to use software that allows for the creation of a large, clean diagram on an infinite canvas. While this method may arrive at a more ‘perfect’ end result, the time to create it almost necessitates that it is done by a solo individual, and thus the key process of arriving at a mutually agreed-upon UML has been missed, and the document will hold less authoritative weight in the minds of the team. 1.3 Enter Speech2Text Speech2Text is a collaborative NLP tool that will allow for the best of both worlds: converting the speech of an actively brainstorming group of developers into a clear UML class diagram on an infinite canvas. Several components will be connected to make the tool: A Speech-to-Text-WaveNet will convert the users’ speech to text. With Amazon Lex serving as the primary chat engine, SpaCy and ParlAI will power additional language comprehension tasks. And by utilizing trained Cortical.io semantic fingerprints, synonymous commands can be perceived (so “let’s make” can trigger the same actions as “let’s create” without all such terms needing to be hard coded). Once the language has been processed, TinkerPop3 will provide the graph’s knowledge storage, traversal and manipulation. The graph will be visually rendered to the display canvas via d3. The system will provide visual feedback to the group, such as a cloud with a question mark when too many voices are speaking at once for it to hear what is being said. This will provide intuitive feedback and positive reinforcement of avoiding excessive interruptions and crosstalk. The system will also provide a standard GUI interface for parallel creation and editing of the class diagrams to allow for quick &amp; easy correction of errors made by the system, thus ensuring the tool is not rendered useless by a few errors. The process will be based on previous work by Kumar, et al.(Kumar et al. 2017) As the process is refined, hardware needs will need to be determined such that processing can happen in realtime. 1.4 A case for text to graphs for NLU In addition to this immediate use case, this project serves as a first step towards another, longer-term goal: the creation of machine systems that can parse longer text inputs, remembering attributes of multiple parties described and understanding the developing relationships &amp; potential dynamics between them. I believe that to develop this kind of understanding requires the conversion of text into knowledge graphs or similar structures. UML class diagrams serve as the initial target for this treatment due to their use of standard terminology (like “class”, “method” and “inherits from”), their clear purpose of describing interactions between OOP classes, and their frequent use by technophiles who might more readily adopt this novel approach to working with familiar documents.

["wisdom-tooth.html", "2 The Wisdom Tooth: Automatic daily diagnostics of oral fluids 2.1 The need for in-home diagnostics 2.2 Enter the Wisdom Tooth 2.3 Health Intervention at the Earliest Possible Stage", " 2 The Wisdom Tooth: Automatic daily diagnostics of oral fluids Keywords Healthcare Biotechnology Diagnostics Health Tech 2.1 The need for in-home diagnostics The CDC says that in the US, up to 40% of deaths from each of 5 leading causes might be preventable.(“CDC Press Releases” 2016) They suggest that poor behavioral choices, like high cholesterol diets and cigarette smoking, lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other ailments. In fact, almost half of all US adults (47%) demonstrate at least one of the three major risk factors for CVD: uncontrolled high blood pressure, uncontrolled high levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol, or are smokers. (“Prevalence of Uncontrolled Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease: United States, 19992010,” n.d.) Nevertheless, up to one-third of Americans say they avoid going to the doctor. (“Why Do People Avoid Medical Care? A Qualitative Study Using National Data,” n.d.) This adds up to the fact that many Americans are living lifestyles that put them at risk, but are avoiding doctor visits, and are thus failing to receive the feedback that could allow for real change that would help them avoid preventable death. It’s time for the average American to be able to get more frequent feedback on how their lifestyle is effecting their health. Fortunately, developments in salivary diagnostics have led to tests for biomarkers of cancers, Alzheimer’s disease, viruses including HIV, various harmful bacteria, and more.(Rathnayake et al. 2017) This has led to calls for dentists to take a more active role in diagnoses. But we say we can take this further, and bring the salivary diagnostic device into the home. 2.2 Enter the Wisdom Tooth The Wisdom Tooth is a small device, about the size of a toothbrush holder, designed with a ceramic exterior to fit in with the aesthetics of many American bathrooms. It is intended to sit on a bathroom sink countertop or in a medicine cabinet wherever an individual would store his or her toothbrush and other oral hygiene products. Its tooth theme is designed to encourage user adoption by encouraging marketing efforts that strongly associate its use with potential users’ existing habits of dental care. From the top of the device, the user will pull a test strip, about the size of a breath-freshening strip that sits on the user’s tongue. The user will place this test strip on his or her tongue for thirty seconds and do some swishing to ensure it is coated in saliva. The test strip will have a variety of reactive salivary diagnostic compounds embedded in it, and various dots will appear to indicate varying levels of reactivity within the saliva. In addition to the salivary diagnostic dots, the strip will have one or more red control borders, which should always appear to indicate that sufficient saliva coverage has been achieved. Because the strip will be read by a computer, much smaller amounts of diagnostic compounds could be utilized than if the strip was to be read by a human. Many diagnostic tests could be included on one strip, including tests for viruses , biomarkers that might correspond to various cancers, or simply high LDL cholesterol levels. Because the strips would be sold in packs, not each strip needs to be identical, but could include a rotation of many different diangostic tests across a week’s or month’s worth of tests. The strip will be placed into a rinsable tray in a drawer designed to hold it in place, and the drawer will be closed. The device’s internal camera will calibrate itself against a gray strip on the tray to adjust to current lighting conditions. It will then capture imagery of the test strip to read the results. By utilzing a camera within an enclosed, lighting-controlled environment, the evaluation of the test strips will be more objective &amp; accurate than relying on untrained individuals in highly varying lighting conditions to diagnose their own results. The Wisdom Tooth will pair with the user’s smartphone via Bluetooth to control the functions of the device, provide computing resources and receive results. Focus group testing will allow us to determine whether adding functionality as a Bluetooth speaker will also be advisable. 2.3 Health Intervention at the Earliest Possible Stage By creating an easy at-home test with a low footprint that can utilize cartridges of various test strips, the ability to detect many conditions early and at low cost will allow for early intervention and care. And the frequency of tests will allow for users to receive more immediate feedback when lifestyle changes lead to either increases or decreases in dangerous lipid levels. The Wisdom Tooth in the longterm offers the user the benefit of detection of a huge array of health issues at the earliest possible stage, while maintaining full control over their own health information.
