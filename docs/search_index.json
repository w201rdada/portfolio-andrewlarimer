It’s common knowledge that the quality of a project is usually a direct result of the amount of planning that goes into it. Nevertheless, project creators frequently bypass critical planning steps. In software development, UML class diagrams are one of those documents that are too frequently skipped. These diagrams provide concrete, visual representations of how the various elements of a software system will divide responsibilities and interact with one another. And the process of collaboratively creating them allows everyone to be present for certain decisions that define the heuristics for a given software system. Without completing that process and arriving at robust class diagrams, a development team progresses more slowly, risks redundant components being created, and must constantly navigate issues of ambiguity related to the project scope, the working metaphor(s) of the system, and the division of work among the team. An example of a UML diagram is presented here: An example of a UML Class Diagram 1.2 So if they are so important, why are these documents skipped? Because of the inadequate tools currently used to create them. One common tool for collaborative diagramming is the whiteboard. While whiteboard sketches facilitate the collaborative brainstorming process, the size of the canvas is quite limited, and unless there is a very talented moderator, only a very limited portion of a project can be visualized before the board is full or the lines have become too messy to proceed. The alternate method is to use software that allows for the creation of a large, clean diagram on an infinite canvas. While this method may arrive at a more ‘perfect’ end result, the time to create it almost necessitates that it is done by a solo individual, and thus the key process of arriving at a mutually agreed-upon UML has been missed, and the document will hold less authoritative weight in the minds of the team. 1.3 Enter Speech2Text Speech2Text is a collaborative NLP tool that will allow for the best of both worlds: converting the speech of an actively brainstorming group of developers into a clear UML class diagram on an infinite canvas. Several components will be connected to make the tool: A Speech-to-Text-WaveNet will convert the users’ speech to text. With Amazon Lex serving as the primary chat engine, SpaCy and ParlAI will power additional language comprehension tasks. And by utilizing trained Cortical.io semantic fingerprints, synonymous commands can be perceived (so “let’s make” can trigger the same actions as “let’s create” without all such terms needing to be hard coded). Once the language has been processed, TinkerPop3 will provide the graph’s knowledge storage, traversal and manipulation. The graph will be visually rendered to the display canvas via d3. The system will provide visual feedback to the group, such as a cloud with a question mark when too many voices are speaking at once for it to hear what is being said. This will provide intuitive feedback and positive reinforcement of avoiding excessive interruptions and crosstalk. The system will also provide a standard GUI interface for parallel creation and editing of the class diagrams to allow for quick &amp; easy correction of errors made by the system, thus ensuring the tool is not rendered useless by a few errors. The process will be based on previous work by Kumar, et al.(Kumar et al. 2017) As the process is refined, hardware needs will need to be determined such that processing can happen in realtime. 1.4 A case for text to graphs for NLU In addition to this immediate use case, this project serves as a first step towards another, longer-term goal: the creation of machine systems that can parse longer text inputs, remembering attributes of multiple parties described and understanding the developing relationships &amp; potential dynamics between them. I believe that to develop this kind of understanding requires the conversion of text into knowledge graphs or similar structures. UML class diagrams serve as the initial target for this treatment due to their use of standard terminology (like “class”, “method” and “inherits from”), their clear purpose of describing interactions between OOP classes, and their frequent use by technophiles who might more readily adopt this novel approach to working with familiar documents.

["wisdom-tooth.html", "2 The Wisdom Tooth: Automatic daily diagnostics of oral fluids 2.1 In-home salivary diagnostics for heart disease 2.2 Enter the Wisdom Tooth 2.3 Health Intervention at the Earliest Possible Stage", " 2 The Wisdom Tooth: Automatic daily diagnostics of oral fluids Keywords Healthcare Biotechnology Diagnostics Health Tech 2.1 In-home salivary diagnostics for heart disease Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the US, leading to the deaths of 600,000 people each year. (???) Nearly 31% of deaths globally are reported to be caused by cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). (???) And almost half of all US adults (47%) have at least one of the three major risk factors for CVD: uncontrolled high blood pressure, uncontrolled high levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol, or are smokers. (???) Current cholesterol tests require multiple doctors visits, with one visit for a blood sample to be drawn, and another visit to discuss the results with the physician. These doctors visits are a deterrent to the identification of CVD risks in many people, as up to one-third of Americans say they avoid going to the doctor. (???) Smartphone-enabled cholesterol blood tests that people can use at home have been developed, with results as accurate as clinical tests(???), but those tests require collecting a drop of blood. Studies of individuals with diabetes have shown that pain of pinpricks are a barriere to recommended daily Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG), with one patient saying, “Once you prick, you will still jump a bit. Whoever says no pain is faking it. If I test every day, my fingers will have many holes, very painful. [P08, 48-year-old female housewife, diabetes for 1 year]”(???). This pain, along with other factors like cost, lead to only 26% of Americans with diabetes using insulin practicing the recommended daily SMBG tests.(???) Fortunately, cholesterol levels in the saliva, which is less painful and easier to collect, can indicate high levels of cholesterol in the blood.(???) 2.2 Enter the Wisdom Tooth By combining elements of the design of the smartphone-enabled blood test with test strips designed to test for cholesterol via saliva, we will create a device that can help people monitor for high cholesterol levels without doctors visits or pinpricks. Furthermore, by designing the experience of using the device to fit in with existing habits of brushing one’s teeth, we can achieve higher adoption rates by piggy backing on an existing habit. The Wisdom Tooth device will be a small device, about the size of a toothbrush holder, designed with a ceramic exterior to fit in with the aesthetics of many American bathrooms. It is intended to sit on a bathroom sink countertop or in a medicine cabinet wherever an individual would store his or her toothbrush and other oral hygiene products. The at-home smartphone-enabled blood test used the smartphone’s flash and camera to illuminate and capture imagery to analyze of the blood sample. Instead of utilizing the camera from the user’s smartphone, which requires inserting the smartphone into the device, the Wisdom Tooth will have its own diffuse light source and camera. The price of small on-chip cameras have gone down significantly, and we feel that the insertion of the phone into the device would be a barrier to user adoption and increase the rate of obsolecense as phone models change. The Wisdom Tooth will instead pair with a user’s smartphone via Bluetooth to control the functions of the device, provide computing resources and receive results. A small slide tray will be removed from the device by the user, saliva will be spit into a reservoir at one end of the slide, and a sliding squeegee will remove excess saliva from the reservoir and the tray surface. The tray will then be inserted into the device, and the accompanying app opened on the user’s smartphone to initiate the test. The device will spool forward and cut a small strip of physically reactive test strip, and microfluidic channels in the tray will direct the saliva to the test strip. The device’s camera will calibrate itself against a gray strip on the tray to adjust to current lighting conditions. It will then capture imagery of the test strip. The test strip is a physical strip, and thus supplies of this would need to be re-ordered or delivered via a subscription to the user. By utilzing a camera within an enclosed, lighting-controlled environment, the evaluation of the test strips will be more objective &amp; accurate than relying on untrained individuals in highly varying lighting conditions to diagnose their own results. 2.3 Health Intervention at the Earliest Possible Stage In addition to detecting CVD risks, developments in salivary diagnostics have led to tests for biomarkers of cancers, Alzheimer’s disease, viruses including HIV, various harmful bacteria, and more.(???) By creating an easy at-home test that can utilize cartridges of various test strips, the ability to detect many conditions early and at low cost will allow for early intervention and care. And the frequency of tests will allow for users to receive more immediate feedback when lifestyle changes lead to either increases or decreases in dangerous lipid levels. The Wisdom Tooth in the longterm offers the user the benefit of detection of a huge array of health issues at the earliest possible stage, while maintaining full control over their own health information.
