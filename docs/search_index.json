Speech2Graph: Graphical representation at the speed of speech. In my first project for UC Berkeley’s RDADA class, I discuss how a system might build out graph databases from spoken collaborations. About Andrew Larimer Andrew is a data scientist, entrepreneur &amp; theatre artist. Andrew Larimer was the founding Artistic Director of The NOLA Project theatre company, and has produced, written, and directed in the New Orleans theatre for thirteen years. He wrote &amp; directed Get This Lake Off My House, an early original hit for The NOLA Project after Hurricane Katrina. Most recently he wrote &amp; directed Exterior. Pool - Night, performed at the Aloft Downtown New Orleans hotel. He has also directed A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Adventures in Wonderland at NOMA’s Besthoff Sculpture Garden, both of which earned him Big Easy Awards as Best Director of a Comedy. Andrew also owns, executive produces and writes for FatHappy Media, a local media production company. He is now pursuing a Master of Information and Data Science at U.C. Berkeley.

It’s common knowledge that the quality of a project is usually a direct result of the amount of planning that goes into it. Nevertheless, project creators frequently bypass critical planning steps. In software development, UML class diagrams are one of those documents that are too frequently skipped. These diagrams provide concrete, visual representations of how the various elements of a software system will divide responsibilities and interact with one another. And the process of collaboratively creating them allows everyone to be present for certain decisions that define the heuristics for a given software system. Without completing that process and arriving at robust class diagrams, a development team progresses more slowly, risks redundant components being created, and must constantly navigate issues of ambiguity related to the project scope, the working metaphor(s) of the system, and the division of work among the team. An example of a UML diagram is presented here: An example of a UML Class Diagram 1.2 So if they are so important, why are these documents skipped? Because of the inadequate tools currently used to create them. One common tool for collaborative diagramming is the whiteboard. While whiteboard sketches facilitate the collaborative brainstorming process, the size of the canvas is quite limited, and unless there is a very talented moderator, only a very limited portion of a project can be visualized before the board is full or the lines have become too messy to proceed. The alternate method is to use software that allows for the creation of a large, clean diagram on an infinite canvas. While this method may arrive at a more ‘perfect’ end result, the time to create it almost necessitates that it is done by a solo individual, and thus the key process of arriving at a mutually agreed-upon UML has been missed, and the document will hold less authoritative weight in the minds of the team. 1.3 Enter Speech2Text Speech2Text is a collaborative NLP tool that will allow for the best of both worlds: converting the speech of an actively brainstorming group of developers into a clear UML class diagram on an infinite canvas. Several components will be connected to make the tool: A Speech-to-Text-WaveNet will convert the users’ speech to text. With Amazon Lex serving as the primary chat engine, SpaCy and ParlAI will power additional language comprehension tasks. And by utilizing trained Cortical.io semantic fingerprints, synonymous commands can be perceived (so “let’s make” can trigger the same actions as “let’s create” without all such terms needing to be hard coded). Once the language has been processed, TinkerPop3 will provide the graph’s knowledge storage, traversal and manipulation. The graph will be visually rendered to the display canvas via d3. The system will provide visual feedback to the group, such as a cloud with a question mark when too many voices are speaking at once for it to hear what is being said. This will provide intuitive feedback and positive reinforcement of avoiding excessive interruptions and crosstalk. The system will also provide a standard GUI interface for parallel creation and editing of the class diagrams to allow for quick &amp; easy correction of errors made by the system, thus ensuring the tool is not rendered useless by a few errors. The process will be based on previous work by Kumar, et al.(Kumar et al. 2017) As the process is refined, hardware needs will need to be determined such that processing can happen in realtime. 1.4 A case for text to graphs for NLU In addition to this immediate use case, this project serves as a first step towards another, longer-term goal: the creation of machine systems that can parse longer text inputs, remembering attributes of multiple parties described and understanding the developing relationships &amp; potential dynamics between them. I believe that to develop this kind of understanding requires the conversion of text into knowledge graphs or similar structures. UML class diagrams serve as the initial target for this treatment due to their use of standard terminology (like “class”, “method” and “inherits from”), their clear purpose of describing interactions between OOP classes, and their frequent use by technophiles who might more readily adopt this novel approach to working with familiar documents.
